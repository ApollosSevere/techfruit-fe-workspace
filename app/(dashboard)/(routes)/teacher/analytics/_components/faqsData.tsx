Recognizing the severity of the issue, I immediately brought it to the attention of my team. We collectively brainstormed potential solutions and weighed the pros and cons of each approach. After thorough discussion and analysis, we arrived at the idea of implementing a white list/black list solution.

This solution involved creating two separate lists: a white list containing only the selected filters and a black list containing the remaining filters. When a user selects the "select all" button for a category, the system automatically adds all filters from that category to the white list while excluding them from the black list. This way, only the selected filters are sent to the backend services, mitigating the performance impact.

Implementing the white list/black list solution required collaboration across different teams, including frontend and backend developers, as well as thorough testing to ensure its effectiveness and reliability. However, the effort was well worth it as it successfully addressed the performance issues while still providing users with the desired functionality.

Through effective teamwork, problem-solving, and collaboration, we were able to overcome a significant challenge and deliver a solution that not only met user expectations but also improved the overall performance and stability of our application. This experience reinforced the importance of communication, creativity, and teamwork in problem-solving within a project environment.`,
